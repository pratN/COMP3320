##Setting up the environment

These steps are for IntelliJ IDEA, it has a community edition available [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), as well as a pro version that is free with a student account. The community edition has everything you need to be able to use the framework used. If you use eclipse or netbeans the tutorial on setting up the environment is [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment-%28Eclipse%2C-Intellij-IDEA%2C-NetBeans%29).

###Required Downloads
+ [JDK 7+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), 6 or earlier won't be compatible
+ [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#resources). Only need the SDK at the bottom of the page, under command line tools. Extract and run the SDK manager to get the latest stable build

###Set environment variables
Set an environment variable called ANDROID_HOME that points to the android sdk

##Setting up the project
